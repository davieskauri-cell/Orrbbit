# INTRO — Product Requirements Document

## Product
INTRO — proximity-based social app. Tagline: "Real people. Real moments." Promise: "See who's open to connecting nearby, right now."
Users pre-signal a social intention ("vibe"). Compatible users physically nearby (≤100m HARD CAP) receive gentle pings, can view each other's profile, and on mutual acceptance unlock temporary (15-minute) approximate meetup location sharing.

## Status: FULL MVP COMPLETE + SAFETY/TRIAL UPDATE (July 2026)
Tested: 22/22 (iteration_2) + 10/10 new backend cases + frontend flows (iteration_3).

## Safety & trial-readiness update (July 2026)
- Positioning: "See who nearby is open to being approached." (consent-based icebreaker)
- Approach Confidence: vibe-based icebreaker openers on Match screen (src/lib/icebreakers.ts)
- Match copy: "You both accepted 🎉" → Continue → Safety Confirmation screen (5-item checklist) → Meetup
- Location explainer: (auth)/how-location-works.tsx between Welcome and Register
- Visibility sessions: visible_for 15/30/60 min (default 30), visibility_expires_at set server-side, auto-expire watcher in AppContext, session chip on radar, "Visibility ended" state + turn back on
- Quiet Mode: stay visible but receive no pings (privacy toggle + backend gate)
- Approximate distances everywhere: distLabel() "About Xm away" / "Within 100m"
- Profile preview: Active now badge, "Intro safety protected" badge, mutual vibe label, verified checkmark, Block + Report buttons
- Report screen (/report): 6 reasons + optional details; Block ends any active meetup with that user (backend)
- Meetup: Report issue button; ending meetup → Feedback screen (spoke/experience/comments → POST /api/feedback)
- Trial Mode (/trial): Southbank Social Trial demo event + stats, join/leave, live banner on radar
- Invite (/invite): QR placeholder + intro.app/southbank-trial link
- Test Metrics (/metrics): 11 live counters from GET /api/metrics (demo accounts only, Profile menu)
- Analytics: POST /api/analytics events (signup, vibe_selected, profile_view, match_created, meetup_started/ended, feedback_submitted)
- Verified placeholder: per-account flags (Sarah/Jake/Liam/Emily unverified), checkmarks in lists/profile
- Improved empty states with Increase radius / Invite people / Change vibe actions; Busy state with Change vibe
- Under-18 message: "INTRO is currently only available for users 18 and older."

## Core rules
- Max distance: 100m — never show/ping/match beyond it (enforced server-side in /api/nearby, state radius clamp 10–100).
- Radius options: 10 / 25 / 50 / 100m, default 50m.
- 8 vibes: open_to_chat (teal), relationship (pink), coffee_drinks (orange), networking (teal), need_advice (purple), gym_buddy (green), exploring (amber), busy (grey, matches no one). Compatibility graph in server.py COMPAT.
- Privacy: opt-in location, visibility/ghost/pause toggles, no exact GPS shown, meetup sharing expires after 15 min, block/report.
- Demo mode: GPS denied → Melbourne CBD fallback; demo users positioned at fixed offsets (Sarah 25m … Emily 94m). Ping generator runs every 20s, 2-min per-person throttle, picks closest compatible user.

## Branding
White bg, Orange #FF5A1F, Teal #20B2AA, Pink #FF2D55, text #111827/#6B7280, card #F8FAFC, border #E5E7EB. Radar-wave logo (src/components/Logo.tsx + generated app icons via /app/scripts/gen_icons.py).

## Architecture
- backend/server.py — FastAPI+Mongo: auth (register 18+/login/demo-login), vibes, demo-accounts, profile/state, nearby (compute_nearby w/ blocks, ghost, only_same_vibe, verified_only filters), pings (generate/list/dismiss/accept), matches, meetups (15-min expiry), encounters, blocks, reports. 10 demo accounts seeded on startup (password Intro123!).
- frontend/app: (auth)/ onboarding|login|register|profile-setup|choose-vibe; (tabs)/ index(Radar)|nearby|pings|encounters|profile; modals: vibe, person/[id], match, meetup, privacy, safety, demo-accounts, edit-profile.
- frontend/src: context (AuthContext w/ session token, AppContext w/ location + nearby 8s poll + ping 20s poll), services (auth/user/location/matching/ping/meetup/privacy/safety/notification per spec), components (RadarView, PingModal, MeetupMap stylised, Avatar w/ initials fallback, VibePicker, UserRow, PrimaryButton, InterestChip, ToggleRow, EmptyState, VibePill, Logo).

## Key endpoints
POST /api/auth/{register,login,demo-login}; GET /api/auth/me, /api/vibes, /api/demo-accounts;
PUT /api/users/me, /api/users/me/state; GET /api/nearby?lat&lng;
POST /api/pings/generate?lat&lng, GET /api/pings, POST /api/pings/{id}/{dismiss,accept};
POST /api/matches; POST /api/meetups, GET /api/meetups/active?lat&lng, POST /api/meetups/{id}/end;
GET /api/encounters; POST /api/blocks, /api/reports.

## Notes / known limitations
- Notifications: in-app PingModal only (Expo Go can't do real push); notificationService is a stub for a future dev build.
- Social sign-in buttons (Apple/Google) are visual placeholders → "coming soon" alert.
- Native map not used — MeetupMap is a stylised custom component (works web + native, spec asked for stylised map).
- Web preview always uses demo location (browser denies GPS in iframe).

## Backlog / next
- Real push notifications via Emergent-managed push (needs dev build + user request).
- Photo upload (currently preset avatar picker).
- Visible-for timer actually expiring visibility (currently stored setting only).
- Verified badge flow.

## Global-Scale & Market-Ready Update (June 2026) — COMPLETE
Backend (server.py):
- Static demo data: CITIES (7, Melbourne "Trial Active"), ZONES (7 Melbourne zones), DEMO_EVENT, DEMO_CAMPUS, COMMUNITIES (12), MODES, AMBASSADOR_DEMO (Kauri), GLOBAL_DEMO_USERS (12 across London/NY/Toronto/Auckland/Singapore, seeded on startup, <=100m in own city).
- Endpoints: GET /api/cities, /api/events/demo, /api/campus, /api/communities, /api/modes, /api/ambassador, /api/trial-report, /api/north-star; POST /api/waitlist. GET /api/metrics extended (waitlist_signups, ambassador_invites, event_joins, signups_by_city). /api/demo-accounts returns city/mode/verified. PUT /api/users/me/state accepts mode/city/country/intent. Nearby is city-scoped (only same-city users appear).
Frontend:
- New screens: /cities (city list + Melbourne zones), /city/[name] (INTRO {CITY} landing template: live stats or waitlist CTA + ambassador CTA), /waitlist (form → POST /api/waitlist, success state, ?city=&ambassador=1 params), /ambassador (stats grid + task checklist + invite), /trial-report (summary + export PDF placeholder alert), /launch-checklist (3-section internal checklist w/ progress), /event-mode, /campus, /networking, /communities, (auth)/intent ("What brings you to Intro?" 6 options after register, saves intent, skippable).
- ModeSelector (src/components/ModeSelector.tsx) on Radar: Social/Networking/Campus/Events/Communities/Dating/Fitness chips; sets user.mode via state API; chips with screens navigate to them.
- Profile: "Intro Worldwide" menu section (Cities, Event Mode, Campus, Networking, Communities, Ambassador Hub, Join Waitlist) + "Trial Tools" for demo users (Test Metrics, Trial Report, Launch Checklist).
- Metrics screen: North Star card (Confirmed Conversations today/week/city/event/total via /api/north-star) + Signups by city list.
- Demo Accounts: filters by City / Vibe / Mode chips + Verified-only checkbox, live count "X of Y".
- strings.ts (src/lib/strings.ts): localization-ready copy constants (English only; partial adoption — new screens use it, older screens still hardcoded = P2 backlog).
Fixes this session:
- session.ts seeds token synchronously from localStorage on web (fixes 401 on direct URL access/refresh of authed screens).
- PingModal auto-dismisses on route change (no longer blocks screens after navigating).
Testing: iteration_4.json — backend 15/15 new + 32 regression pass; frontend ~92% pass, 2 medium issues found & fixed above.

## Backlog / next (updated)
- P2: migrate remaining hardcoded strings in older screens (radar, auth, profile, safety) to strings.ts.
- Refactor: split 945-line server.py into routes/models modules.
- shadow* → boxShadow style migration (web deprecation warnings only).
- Real push notifications (dev build + user request), photo upload, verified badge flow.
