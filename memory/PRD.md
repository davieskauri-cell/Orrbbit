# INTRO — Product Requirements Document

## Product
INTRO — proximity-based social app. Tagline: "Real people. Real moments." Promise: "See who's open to connecting nearby, right now."
Users pre-signal a social intention ("vibe"). Compatible users physically nearby (≤100m HARD CAP) receive gentle pings, can view each other's profile, and on mutual acceptance unlock temporary (15-minute) approximate meetup location sharing.

## Status: FULL MVP COMPLETE (July 2026 rebuild per detailed user spec)
Tested: 22/22 backend pytest cases + all frontend flows pass (test_reports/iteration_2.json).

## Core rules
- Max distance: 100m — never show/ping/match beyond it (enforced server-side in /api/nearby, state radius clamp 10–100).
- Radius options: 10 / 25 / 50 / 100m, default 50m.
- 8 vibes: open_to_chat (teal), relationship (pink), coffee_drinks (orange), networking (teal), need_advice (purple), gym_buddy (green), exploring (amber), busy (grey, matches no one). Compatibility graph in server.py COMPAT.
- Privacy: opt-in location, visibility/ghost/pause toggles, no exact GPS shown, meetup sharing expires after 15 min, block/report.
- Demo mode: GPS denied → Melbourne CBD fallback; demo users positioned at fixed offsets (Sarah 25m … Emily 94m). Ping generator runs every 20s, 2-min per-person throttle, picks closest compatible user.

## Branding
White bg, Orange #FF5A1F, Teal #20B2AA, Pink #FF2D55, text #111827/#6B7280, card #F8FAFC, border #E5E7EB. Radar-wave logo (src/components/Logo.tsx + generated app icons via /app/scripts/gen_icons.py).

## Architecture
- backend/server.py — FastAPI+Mongo: auth (register 18+/login/demo-login), vibes, demo-accounts, profile/state, nearby (compute_nearby w/ blocks, ghost, only_same_vibe, verified_only filters), pings (generate/list/dismiss/accept), matches, meetups (15-min expiry), encounters, blocks, reports. 10 demo accounts seeded on startup (password Intro123!).
- frontend/app: (auth)/ onboarding|login|register|profile-setup|choose-vibe; (tabs)/ index(Radar)|nearby|pings|encounters|profile; modals: vibe, person/[id], match, meetup, privacy, safety, demo-accounts, edit-profile.
- frontend/src: context (AuthContext w/ session token, AppContext w/ location + nearby 8s poll + ping 20s poll), services (auth/user/location/matching/ping/meetup/privacy/safety/notification per spec), components (RadarView, PingModal, MeetupMap stylised, Avatar w/ initials fallback, VibePicker, UserRow, PrimaryButton, InterestChip, ToggleRow, EmptyState, VibePill, Logo).

## Key endpoints
POST /api/auth/{register,login,demo-login}; GET /api/auth/me, /api/vibes, /api/demo-accounts;
PUT /api/users/me, /api/users/me/state; GET /api/nearby?lat&lng;
POST /api/pings/generate?lat&lng, GET /api/pings, POST /api/pings/{id}/{dismiss,accept};
POST /api/matches; POST /api/meetups, GET /api/meetups/active?lat&lng, POST /api/meetups/{id}/end;
GET /api/encounters; POST /api/blocks, /api/reports.

## Notes / known limitations
- Notifications: in-app PingModal only (Expo Go can't do real push); notificationService is a stub for a future dev build.
- Social sign-in buttons (Apple/Google) are visual placeholders → "coming soon" alert.
- Native map not used — MeetupMap is a stylised custom component (works web + native, spec asked for stylised map).
- Web preview always uses demo location (browser denies GPS in iframe).

## Backlog / next
- Real push notifications via Emergent-managed push (needs dev build + user request).
- Photo upload (currently preset avatar picker).
- Visible-for timer actually expiring visibility (currently stored setting only).
- Verified badge flow.
